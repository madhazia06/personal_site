# Madha Zia (Personal Portfolio Website)

I have designed a personal portfolio website to introduce **myself** and to showcase my journey in a clean, easy-to-navigate way. The website is designed for visitors to quickly learn about my **education, research work, achievements, skills, hobbies, and contact details**.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this website is to:
- Present my profile in a creative format
- Highlight academic background and interests
- Share research projects with links to full documents
- Display my achievements in an interactive way

## Pages Included
- **Home (index.html):**  
  A desk illustration with clickable objects (image map). Each object takes you to a different section of the website.

- **Education (education.html):**  
  Show my academic timeline with short details and images of institutions.

- **Research (research.html):**  
  Lists research projects (essay/report), skills used, and links to read the full work.

  A slideshow-style section where users can click **Previous/Next** to view awards. The image and description change using JavaScript.

  Categorized skills section with icons (design tools, web/programming, productivity/data tools).

- **Hobbies (hobbies.html):**  
  Displays hobbies using icons and short labels.

  A small contact form where users can write an email and message. A confirmation alert appears on submission.

  Icons are used across navigation and content to make the UI look more user-friendly and readable.

  The achievements page uses JavaScript arrays to switch images and descriptions with Next/Previous buttons.
